About the GAUL documentation
============================

For the time-being, all documentation will be placed on the GAUL website.  Eventually this directory will contain tutorial and reference material, but until then see:

http://gaul.sourceforge.net/

For your (and my) convenience, a poorly synchronised version of the website will be kept in the /docs/html/ directory.
