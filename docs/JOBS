A list of jobs for which I would like help:
===========================================

* Portability
  - Compiling code on alternative systems, to check and improve portability.

* Example/test programs
  - Ports of the example programs from Goldberg's book.
  - Examples using the steady-state GA.
  - An automated test script for the GAUL algorithms/features.
  - An automated test script for the utility functions
    (most notably the random number generator)
  - Quite simply, more test programs are required.

* Feedback
  - Reports of bugs that need fixing.
  - Requests for features that should be added.

* Benchmarking
  - I would like to see benchmarks for GAUL vs SGA-C, gallops, galib, sugal etc.
    (I found in a totally unscientific and unfair test that GAUL completed
    Goldberg's examples 1 and 2 in approximately 10% of the time required by
    galib)

* Modification of build script.
  - Modify configure.in/Makefile.am for production of source and binary packages
  (RPMs and Debian packages)

* Translation.
  - Translation of the documentation. (And encouragement for me to write more of the stuff.)
