SHORT TODO LIST FOR GAUL
========================
The following list conmtains the most urgent things to be done.  These are, or at least should be, my current development priorities.

* Convert core routines so that they are chromosome data type agnostic.
* Operators for alternative chromosome types, including:
  - Binary chromosomes
  - Variable length array chromsomes
  - Tree chromosomes
* Entity user data should be stored in an array instead of a list.
* Lots of examples.
* Lots of documentation!
