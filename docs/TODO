SHORT TODO LIST FOR GAUL
========================
The following list conmtains the most urgent things to be done.  These are, or at least should be, my current development priorities.

* Operators for alternative chromosome types, including:
  - Variable length array chromsomes
  - Tree chromosomes
  - Permutation chromosomes
* Built-in support for, so-called, Messy-GAs.
* Entity user data should be stored in an array instead of a list.
* Fix the read/write and parallel routines.
* Lots more examples.
  - Optimising a Neural Network?
  - Points on a sphere?
  - More examples to accompany the tutorial.
* Lots of documentation.
  - Reference Manual
  - Tutorial
* add lots of convenience (high level) functions to src/ga_utility.c
* ga_genesis prototype is now a mess.  Need to replace this with simpler high level function(s) and a set of low level functions.
* Fix elitism.
* Accessor functions for accessing chromosome data etc. in preparation for language bindings.
