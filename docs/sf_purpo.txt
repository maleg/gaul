GAUL: Genetic Algorithm Utility Library

GAUL is a flexible programming library designed to aid in the development of applications that require the use of genetic algorithms.  It provides data structures and functions for handling and manipulation of the data required for a genetic algorithm.  Additional stochastic algorithms are provided for comparison to the genetic algorithms.  Much of the functionality is also vailable through a simple SLang interface.

The aim of this project is to produce documentation, examples and test cases for the open-source release of GAUL.  Several new features are also planned for GAUL including wrappers to enable its use with programming languages other than C.

The primary tasks which need to be completed before the version 1.0 release are:
1) Write a set of test cases which may be used to ensure the stability of the solutions and robustness of the library.  These will also help to direct optimisations in the core routines.
2) Document the API, produce tutorial and reference material.
3) Modify the code to allow variable length chromosomes.
4) Incorporate a steady-state genetic algorithm.
5) Test whether GAUL compiles successfully on the Darwin OS. [ Sorry, I couldn't resist ;) ]
