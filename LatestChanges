Changes since release 0.1831:

- Fixed minor bug in ./configure.in, message said "--with-slang=no", but should have said "--enable-slang=no".
- Add files tests/btree.c and tests/btree.h - code doesn't compile without them!
- Some more, really suspect, functions added to src/ga_utility.c.  ga_entity_dump() and ga_population_dump() also added.
- New "printable characters"-based mutations etc.
- A new example program added, tests/struggle.c
- src/libga.a renamed to src/libgaul.a
- Some additional prototypes added into the header files.
- Examples now use ga_chromosome_XXX_to_staticstring() where appropriate.
- Replaced s_calloc() calls in src/ga_chromo.c with s_malloc() calls.
- Fixed bug in ga_select_stats().
- Overhauled tests/Makefile.am
- Fixed serious bug (segfault) in ga_select_roulette_{one|two}().
- Added ga_crossover_char_{singlepoints|doublepoints}().
