GAUL Test/Example code
======================

[ NOTE: HelGA is not currently available publically... It is a huge piece of
  work (The culmination of my PhD research).  It will become available in
  due course.  It relies heavily on GAUL.  It is fully driven by the
  SLang scripting language.  So, if you want to know how to use GAUL in
  a scripted environment, let me now. ]

pingpong	Solves the table-tennis championship problem presented in:
		Dennis E. Shasha, "Dr Ecco's Omniheurist Corner: Foxy",
		Dr Dobb's Journal, 323:148-149 (2001).
		Uses a single 25 integer chromosome with custom mutation
		and crossover operators.
		This is a perturbation problem.

wildfire	Solves the fire-fighting problem presented in:
		Dennis E. Shasha, "Dr Ecco's Omniheurist Corner: Wildfires",
		Dr Dobb's Journal, 320:193-194 (2001).
		Uses a single integer chromosome, treated as a Binary String.
		Should use a single binary chromosome.
		*** As of today (17/05/01) this doesn't work! ***
