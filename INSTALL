GAUL Installation Instructions
==============================

Full (and maybe more up-to-date) instructions are available on the GAUL website.  This file should have just enough detail to help you.

Dependancies:
The only non-trivial pre-requisite for GAUL is slang.  This may be obtained from http://www.s-lang.org/

Also helpful, are Perl5 and the GNU maketools.  You probably have these already if you use your computer for anything non-trivial.

You should be able to work it out, but for any real dumbies out there follow the standard GNU make procedure:
./configure ; make

Or if you don't have SLang installed:
./configure --disable-slang; make

If that doesn't work because you don't have the GNU maketools (or because I made assumptions that are not valid for your native compiler) then we have a problem to sort out.

Email me if:
- You have tried the GNU tools, which you know normally work on your system, but GAUL still doesn't compile (preferably with patches to fix it ;))
- You would like pre-compiled binaries.  Note: I can guarentee to provide Linux binaries only.  I may possibly be able to aquire other binaries, but don't hold your breath. (Send the output from 'uname -a' so I can generate binaries with the correct format -- Or even better, provide the file "config.h" which is produced by running "configure").  I will provide dynamically linked binaries unless you request otherwise.

Potentially supported Platforms:
Linux and other (mostly) POSIX-compliant UNIX OSs on any sensible hardware.  e.g. *BSD, IRIX, Solaris.
Non-toy OSs which are POSIX-compiliant.  e.g. BeOS, QNX.
