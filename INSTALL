Brief GAUL Installation Instructions
====================================

Full (and maybe more up-to-date) instructions are available on the GAUL website.  This file should have just enough detail to help you.

Dependencies:
The only non-trivial pre-requisite for GAUL is slang.  This may be obtained from http://www.s-lang.org/

Also helpful, are Perl5 and the GNU maketools.  You probably have these already if you use your computer for anything non-trivial.

You should be able to work it out, but for any real dummies out there follow the standard GNU make procedure:
./configure ; make

Or if you don't have SLang installed:
./configure --enable-slang=no ; make

If that doesn't work because you don't have the GNU maketools (or because I made assumptions that are not valid for your native compiler) then we have a problem to sort out.

On some systems, including Solaris and IRIX, you need to specify GNU make instead the native make.  In this case substitute 'make' with 'gmake'.

If you grabbed this source directly from the CVS archive and are using anything other than Linux, you will probably need to do something like this:
automake -i ; autoconf ; ./configure --disable-cvs-deps ; gmake

Email me if:
- You have tried the GNU tools, which you know normally work on your system, but GAUL still doesn't compile (preferably with patches to fix it ;))
- You would like pre-compiled binaries.  Note: I can guarantee to provide Linux binaries only.  I may possibly be able to acquire other binaries, but don't hold your breath. (Send the output from 'uname -a' so I can generate binaries with the correct format -- Or even better, provide the file "config.h" which is produced by running "configure").

Potentially supported platforms:
- Linux and other (mostly) POSIX-compliant UNIX OSs on any sensible hardware.  e.g. *BSD, IRIX, Solaris.
- Non-toy OSs which are POSIX-compiliant.  e.g. BeOS, QNX.
