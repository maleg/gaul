GAUL Test/Example code
======================

[ NOTE: HelGA is not currently available publically... It is a huge piece of
  work (The culmination of my PhD research).  It will become available in
  due course.  It relies heavily on GAUL.  It is fully driven by the
  SLang scripting language.  So, if you want to know how to use GAUL in
  a scripted environment, let me now. ]

The following executables will be generated by the make procedure: 

pingpong	Solves the table-tennis championship problem presented in:
		Dennis E. Shasha, "Dr Ecco's Omniheurist Corner: Foxy",
		Dr Dobb's Journal, 323:148-149 (2001).
		Uses a single 25 integer array chromosome with custom
		mutation and crossover operators.
		This is a perturbation problem.

wildfire	Solves the fire-fighting problem presented in:
		Dennis E. Shasha, "Dr Ecco's Omniheurist Corner: Wildfires",
		Dr Dobb's Journal, 320:193-194 (2001).
		Uses a single boolean array chromosome.
		Should use a single binary chromosome.
		WARNING: Slow.

goldberg{1,2}	Ports of the examples from Goldberg's book.

dejong		Port of DeJong's GA test suite.

royalroad	Port of Holland's royal road problem.

struggle	A fairly fairly lean example, showing how little
                application code is needed when using GAUL.
                This program aims to generate the final sentence from
                Chapter 3 of Darwin's "The Origin of Species",
                entitled "Struggle for Existence".
                It uses a character-valued chromosome.
		WARNING: Slow.
